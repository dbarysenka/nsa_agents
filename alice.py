""" Alice knows that NSA agents use the following algorithm to cipher their messages.
    1) They delete all spaces and punctuation marks.
    2) They replace all successive identical letters with only one such letter.
    3) They insert two identical letters at an arbitrary place many times.
    Alice has intercepted some messages which are "meaningless" sequences of letters that NSA agent Bob
    has sent to another NSA agent Alice about possible Aliceâ€™s location. He wants to be able to restore
    the message as it was after step 2). Help Alice write a program in Python that removes all pairs of
    identical letters from the message inserted in the third step.
